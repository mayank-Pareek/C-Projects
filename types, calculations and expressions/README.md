# Types, Calculations and Expressions

In this minor project, I have coded and executed a C language program that stores values in variables of the appropriate data type, performs calculations on the stored variables, and apply relational and logical expressions to determine the true or false result of various test case scenarios.

## Leaning Outcomes

• Select appropriate types for storing program variables and constants

• Create meaningful variable identifiers contributing to easy to read and maintain code

• Code a simple calculation to solve a basic programming task

• Code relational and logical expressions to evaluate the true or false nature of various test statements

• Store user input values to program variables
